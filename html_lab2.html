            Reports reveal that Jordan was not happy with the presentation and even said that he could not wear those shoes as they were 'devil colours'. However, Jordan still agreed to sign with Nike. In a recent interview, David Falk revealed that Nike had shown Jordan his entire line along with a VCR film of his highlights. Jordan, as per Falk, was maintaining a poker face with them which he continued when Nike took then out for dinner afterwards. After they had left, Jordan apparently informed Falk that he liked the brand and wants to sign with them.
